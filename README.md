# Next.js Project with CI/CD Pipeline

깃헙 사용법을 익히기 위해 시작한 저장소에 Next.js 프로젝트를 추가했습니다.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## 🚀 Features

- **Next.js 15.4.7** with App Router
- **TypeScript** support
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **ESLint + Prettier** for code quality
- **Husky + lint-staged** for pre-commit hooks
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD** pipeline
- **Automated deployment** ready

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## 🛠️ Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run start    # Start production server
npm run lint     # Run ESLint
```

## 🔧 CI/CD Pipeline

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that:

- Runs on Node.js 18.x and 20.x
- Performs linting and type checking
- Builds the application
- Ready for deployment to Vercel
